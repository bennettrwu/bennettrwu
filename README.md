Hi, I'm Bennett, a computer science student with a passion for creating software that makes a positive impact.

I've had the opportunity to work on diverse projects, from developing automations that help scientists analyze experiments faster, to migrating APIs in production web applications. I've also created machine learning-powered tools to transcribe classroom audio to improve accessibility. I'm constantly working to improve my skills and dedicated to writing software that can drive meaningful change.

Growing up, I watched hours of videos on computer building and new technological innovations. I was inspired by the power of computing and software, I pursed an education in computer science. Currently, I'm enrolled in the combined BS-MCS program at the University of Illinois, with plans to graduate in Spring 2026.
